Bangladesh is one of the worst countries when it comes to travelling around from one place to another by roads and sea ways. So, in the past few years, we have seen a huge incline of people on using air ways to travel locally from one district to another. Also, as we have a very huge population of skilled labors who migrate to other counties to earn their livelihood, which makes the airlines industry of our country very huge. To make life much easier, we have come up with a web application from where Bangladeshi Citizens will be able to book their tickets by their own without facing any kind of hassle. Our web application will be very user-friendly.\\
